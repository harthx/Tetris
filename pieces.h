 * Shape of each piece is represented by rows in the array.
 * TIP: Name the array what is already been coded to avoid any unwanted errors.

                        The function of these piece arrays has been declared in the 'functionality' array in depth.
                        For example, this row 
                        6 8 10 12
                        corresponds to the array of
                        3 0
                        4 0
                        5 0
                        6 0
                        which implies that there are 4 blocks in subsequent columns in a single row. Aka, the | shape horizontally.
